        <!-- the text below shows examples of italic, bold, underline and how they're interchangable. Also I showed an example of a Line break -->
        My name is Taylor Crawford! I am excited to start ACIT 1620 and develop my skills using <em><b>HTML</b></em>
        <strong><u>JavaScript</u></strong> and <u><i>CSS.</i></u>
        <br> I have a little experience on building a website, however, I am open to all the experience you have to
        share! I am wanting a high grade in this class, and thrive on having the powerpoints and lectures before the
        class
        begins <br> so I can have some knowledge before going into the class!
