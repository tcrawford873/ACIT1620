        <h1> My First Web Page for ACIT 1620!</h1> 
        <p>
            I am excited to start ACIT 1620 and develop my skills using <em><b>HTML</em></b> <strong><u>JavaScript</strong></u> and <u><i>CSS.</u></i>
            I have a little experience on building a website, however, I am open to all the experience you have to share!

            I am wanting a high grade in this class, and thrive on having the powerpoints and lectures before teh class begins so I can have some knowledge before going into the class!
